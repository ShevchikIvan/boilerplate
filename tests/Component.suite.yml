# Codeception Test Suite Configuration
#
# A feature test will regroup a set of classes and services in order to assert
# at a low level that they behave correctly together as a component. You can see
# this as Spec BDDing. To not confuse that with Story BDD, where features are
# tested as the perspective of the acceptance user. Such tests are written with
# Behat.
#
# For example, you might have a bowling game and want to calculate the score of
# that game. You unit test in isolation all your classes, but in the end you
# want to know if you calculate the score of the game correctly, the game score
# calculation is a feature test that can be tested at a low level.
